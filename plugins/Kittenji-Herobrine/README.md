### This mod adds Herobrine as an entity in Lethal Company.

- Silently stares at you from the shadows.
- Do not pay attention to his presence or you will face the consequences.
- Things will happen, it's not just haunting.

> This mod is **NOT** a re-skin and does **NOT** replace any entity in the game.
